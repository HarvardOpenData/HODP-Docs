`Plotly` is a library which allows you to easily make interactive graphs (and these interactive graphs can be added to your articles on our website)!

We'll be using `plotly.graph_objects` because it is highly customizable, but alternatives include `plotly.express` which returns figures of the same type as `plotly.graph_objects` and streamlines much of the process of making graphs, but is less customizable.
