## Types of Articles


#### 1. Traditional Analysis

#### 2. Survey Write-up
HODP has its own survey group, and we occasionally send surveys to the student body at large. After working with our Survey Group PM to craft and send your survey, and you analyze your results in an article. Examples include our pieces on the 2020 Presidential Primaries and on students' COVID-19 situations. TODO: link these to new site.

## How to Write an Article

What's supposed to go in your article? Usually graphs and cool insights. Regardless of the type of article, we recommend the following flow. Your lead editor can give you more individualized advice for your project.

### Introduction and the Question

What questions are you trying to answer? Why did you send out this survey? What interesting info might this dataset contain? Are you trying to investigate or shed light on some campus phenomenon?

This section should make clear what you were trying to find out via this project. It should give the reader an idea for what they're in for, and why it's important or relevant to them.

### The Data and Your Methods

Briefly, what's your data and where did you get it from? If your data collection methods were somewhat involved, briefly described how you acquired your data. If there was something special about your methods (e.g. you employed some complex ML, you scraped something live), talk about it.

We don't want this section to be so long it distracts from getting to the insights. But we want to briefly describe the data so readers can trust your analysis. And if your methods are important to or somehow qualify the validity of your insights, you should acknowledge that upfront. 

If you have a whole lot of info for this section, summarize it quickly and move the rest to an appendix.

### The Insights

Start answering the questions you initially proposed by presenting the results of your analysis (statistical tests, averages, garphs, trends) both visually and numerically.

Explain what each result means, rather than stating a number or the result of a test. Explain and caption graphs, and if explain (briefly) how you got results, if it's something more involved than aggregation or summary statistics.

Feel free to suggeest hypotheses behind your results, but don't speculate too much, and make sure everything you say is related to and supported by data. If you're speculating, say so.

Be sure to note any unexpected results and key trends.

This section should be the bulk of your article.

### Unsanswered Questions

This can happen in the insights section or at the end of it. It's ok to talk about how the data doesn't answer all your questions, or how your results are inconclusive. 

### Conclusion, Significance, Future Work

So what was the point of this project? Overall, what did the data show us, and where does it leave us with respect to your original question? Is there any further work you might want to do? How was your work interesting or important?

Overall, this section should synthesize your key results and connect them back to what you initially set out to learn.

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com/)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com/ "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. http://www.example.com/ or <http://www.example.com/> and sometimes example.com (but not on GitHub, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org/
[1]: http://slashdot.org/
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com/

## Code

```javascript
var s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting';
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```js {2}
function highlightMe() {
  console.log('This line can be highlighted!');
}
```

## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

---

## Inline HTML

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

---

## Line Breaks

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
