This guide assumes no prior programming knowledge and gives a brief introduction to Python, one of the most widely used programming languages. Python is incredibly useful for doing data analysis, especially for large data sets.

This bootcamp will make sure that you are comfortable with basic Python and equip you with the tools to Google and Stack Overflow your way through more projects!

### Variables (strings, ints, floats, booleans) & Operations

A variable is a way to represent data in Python. We declare a variable by giving it a name and a value. Values of the variable can change and can have different types (e.g. integers or strings).

Here is an example of declaring a variable:
```
y = 3.45
```
Here we have a variable `y` and have assigned it the value `3.45`. Variable names must begin with letters.

To print the value of a variable, we pass the variable to a function called `print`.
```
print(y)
```

There are four types of values:

### Lists and List methods

### Dictionaries (+ Sets)

### Conditionals

### Loops

### Functions

### Modules and Packages



## More comfortable topics

Plan: Normal-length presentation, similar activity to last year (read in csv dataset and do some stuff with it)

### File I/O

### Classes and Objects?

### List Comprehension

### Map, Filter, Reduce (and Lambda functions)
