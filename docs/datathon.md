Welcome to the HODP Datathon! On this page you'll find a recap of the milestones for this Datathon, links to the check-in form, as well as the schedule for the day. We won't be posting any links on this page, but you can find them all on the HODP calendar!

## Milestones for the Day
There are three important goals today:
1. **Work with your team to collect, clean or understand your data**: by the end of the day, you should be fairly certain of what questions your data can help you answer.
  1. Where is it coming from? Is there enough of it? Is it comprehensive? Will you need other sources of data?
  2. What programming languages, packages, and libraries will you use?
  3. If you’re working with an API: how do you use it? What kind of data will it provide?
  4. If you’re sending a survey: finalise your survey and send it to your board advisor to review (we want to get this survey out as quickly so you have as much time as possible to analyse the results)
2. **Learn some specialised skills**: pick sessions that will be useful for your project or sessions that seem interesting — the choice is yours! We’re only requiring 2 session this year with the hope that it will give you and your team more time to work on your projects, but you’re of course free to attend more of them. 
3. **Meet some people and have some fun!** We’ll have a link to the HODP Datathon Gather up soon where you and your group can hang. You should also [sign up](https://forms.gle/z43jPES6vbD1mnwp7) for the estimathon as a group! We have prizes for the top 3 teams!

The estimathon counts towards the attendance requirement! If you missed the RSVP deadline — no worries! We’d love to see you there anyway!
