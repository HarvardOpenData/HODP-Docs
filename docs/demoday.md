Congratulations on making it to Demo Day! We're very excited to see the projects you've been working on these last few weeks. 

## Logistics
Some logistics to take note of:
1. To keep things running smoothly, we'll be sharing your presentations from our screen. If you have important updates not reflected in the submitted version of your slides, please let us know asap! 
2. We'll send you a slack message with 30 seconds to go and at time. 30 seconds after time we will cut you off. 
3. We'll make a thread in #bootcamp-f20 for questions, remember to check it after your presentation!
