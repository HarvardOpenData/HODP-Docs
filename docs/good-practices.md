## Data best practices

As a data scientist, you have a responsibility to understand your data, handle it properly, and communicate your findings with honesty and transparency. The first piece - understanding your data - is one of the most important but often overlooked steps to the data science process.

When you find a data set of interest, it may be tempting to hit the ground running, but first it's important to check where your data is coming from. Consider [this](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nigeria-kidnapping/) FiveThirtyEight article, in which the author relied on data from a news reporting database to count the number of kidnappings occurring in Nigeria. It turned out that the database was counting the number of instances kidnappings appeared on the news rather than distinct events; thus, the author misrepresented the magnitude of kidnappings by an exponential amount.

This example also illustrates the importance of understanding the context of your data. Oftentimes, your data points will represent living, breathing individuals, and it is important to keep this in mind as you're working with your data. Who or what is represented by your data? Who or what is *not* represented in your data? [Here](https://gijn.org/2017/03/27/data-biographies-getting-to-know-your-data/) is a good framework to follow in gaining a clearer understanding of your data.

Finally, before diving into your work, ask yourself: What am I trying to achieve through this analysis? What is the end goal, and what do I hope to convey to my readers? This doesn't mean you should know the "answer" to your research question(s) -- that's where the data analysis comes in! -- but it's important to acknowledge the motivation behind your work and lay the foundation for a successful project.

#### Our Open Data Mission

Though HODP's work has diversified over the years, our core purpose is still to make data and its insights accessible. To that end, while you're thinking about projects and later working on one, keep in mind our open data mission:

How can you use data to hold people in power accountable, teach others, or help our community? How can we make our data and analysis themselves accessible and transparent?

When it comes to writing articles, this mission translates to making sure you explain where your data is from, what it contains, and how you extracted insights from it. Use layman's terms and don't assume too much prior knowledge. We want to make sure that our readers trust us and can hold our work accountable as well.

When you publish your article, we'll also ask you to publish your data, raw and cleaned, and your code, for the sake of transparency and for cleaning.

#### Tone of a HODP Article

We're not publishing academic, nor is this a blog. We want to strike a journalistic middle ground. Don't opine or editorialize, but do use layman's terms and explain your work clearly. It's still okay to drop a joke or reference Harvard culture. Generally, err on the side of conversational but professional.
