- **Attendance form**: [hodp.org/attendance](http://hodp.org/attendance)
- **Absence form**: [hodp.org/absences](http://hodp.org/absences)
- **HODP Calendar**: [hodp.org/calendar](http://hodp.org/calendar)

## Bootcamp Requirements
- Our Bootcamp is completion-based (with no experience required). This means that as long as you attend bootcamps, complete a project, and publish it, you will become a HODP member!
- All Bootcampers are given one no-questions-asked skip, to use your skip, please fill out the absence form above! We'll send you a video of the bootcamp afterwards. 
- If you find yourself needing more than one absence, please reach out to `board@hodp.org`.

More information on bootcamp projects will be released later!

## What is a project? 
- Bootcamp projects are a chance for you to apply everything you've learned and to answer a Harvard-related question you're curious about! (see the first few slides of [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16TKe5BfSPDdsWhxm4wtApwk7-ruzwFKmoe30mdr3ez4/edit?usp=sharing) for more details)
- Projects are completed in groups of **two to four**, if you don't already have a group -- that's alright! We'll pair you up with people based on your [project proposal](hodp.org/bootcamp-proposal). 
- A project involves writing both an article and creating a 3-minute presentation for demo day (this is usually a great day involving food and Nick Sinai live-tweeting the event!) For more information on requirements for the article, see the links in Project Resources!
