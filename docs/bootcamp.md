## Bootcamp Requirements
- Our Bootcamp is completion-based (with no experience required). This means that as long as you attend bootcamps, complete a project, and publish it, you will become a HODP member!
- All Bootcampers are given one no-questions-asked skip, to use your skip, please fill out the absence form above! We'll send you a video of the bootcamp afterwards. 
- If you find yourself needing more than one absence, please reach out to board via `board@hodp.org` or on Slack.

More info on bootcamp projects will be released later!

## Project Information
- Bootcamp projects are a chance for you to apply everything you've learned and to answer a data-oriented question (Harvard-related or not) that you're curious about!
- Some sample project ideas are listed on [this spreadsheet](http://hodp.org/bootcamp-projects-f21). You are not limited to choosing one of these projects--we've complied this list for those of you who may not have a project idea in mind. If you choose a project from this list, we'll also help you find the data you need to get started.
- Projects are completed in groups of **two to four**, if you don't already have a group -- that's alright! We'll pair you up with people based on your [project proposal](http://hodp.org/project-form-f21). Please fill out this form by EOD October 14, 2021!
- A project involves writing both an article and creating a 3-minute presentation for our Demo Day(s) (this is usually a great day involving food and Nick Sinai live-tweeting the event)! More info about project finalization steps will be released soon.
For more information on requirements for the article, see the links in Project Resources!
